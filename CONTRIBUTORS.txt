# This is the official list of people who have contributed to JanusGraph Python
# driver.
#
# The AUTHORS.txt file lists the copyright holders; this file lists people. For
# example, employees of an organization who assign copyright to their
# organization are listed here but not in AUTHORS.txt, because their
# organization holds the copyright. Similarly, contributors who assigned
# copyright to a party other than their employer will appear in this list, but
# not in AUTHORS.txt file.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file, either J's name or J's
# organization's name should be added to the AUTHORS.txt file, depending on
# whether the individual or corporate CLA was used.

# The original list was generated via:
#
#     $ git log --all --format='%aN <%cE>' | sort -u --ignore-case
#
# and manual cleanup.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <email1>
#     Individual's name <email1> <email2> <emailN>

# Please keep the list sorted.
